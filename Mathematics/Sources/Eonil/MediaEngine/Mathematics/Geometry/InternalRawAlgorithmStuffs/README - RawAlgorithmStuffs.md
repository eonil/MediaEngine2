README - RawAlgorithmStuffs
===========================



Mathematics library detaches internal algorithm from API.
This namespace contains raw algorithms which doesn't have a well designed API.

These will not be exposed directly to user code.
Though you still can use these, but do not do that. Because internal interfaces
are very likely to be changed later.
