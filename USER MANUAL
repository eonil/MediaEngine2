Getting Started
---------------

	class 
	FooAppDelegate1
	{
		auto	step() -> void;		//!	This method will be called for each frame.
	};
	
	
	int main(int, char**)
	{
		auto	step	=	[]()
		{
			printf("Hello World!");
		};

		Eonil::Improvisations::MediaEngine::Application::run(step);
	}









Explanation and `Application` class
-----------------------------------
MediaEngine library is passive library, and doesn't require your main
application loop. So basically, you have to setup your application loop,
prepare OpenGL drawable surface, and call rendering method yourself. But
that's repeating and boring work, so I prepared convenient helper class
`Application`.

The code will perform every platform specific operations for you. If the platform
support program exit, then this will return grafully by user interaction. If the
platform doesn't support exit, then this will not return. All the application 
events such as foreground, background or hybernation will be handled correctly.

Anyway the class doesn't dispose any OpenGL server-side objects. On iOS this may
cause some problem. Because the OS may kill your process if graphics memory (VRAM)
becomes insufficient when your app is in background. Usually this doesn't matter 
because this is very natural behavior of all iOS apps. But if you want extreme
optimization, then you have to manage them yourself. For that, the `Application`
class will provide several event handlers which can be provided by you for this 
kind of common OS events. But if you want to handle some special OS event, then
you have to build application event loop yourself. 

You can see source code of `Application` class to get idea of how to implement 
application even loop for each platforms. Anyway the implementation of 
`Application` isn't fixed, so can be changed at any time.



Note for OS X Application Xcode Project 
---------------------------------------
When you create OS X application project in Xcode 5, it will create default NIB
configuration for you. It contains pre-configured application-delegate, and that
will override application-delegate set by this `Application` class. So you have
to delete application-delegate configuration from the NIB file to make the 
`Application` class to work correctly. To do this, simply delete any NIB file
created by Xcode project template, and re-create whatever NIB your want.














Threading Note
--------------
OpenGL is designed in manner of server-client architecture. OpenGL is just
an API to access features on remote server, and there is no benefit to be
multi-threaded on client-side.

Consequently, all OpenGL functions are is designed to be single-threaded.
And naturally, `MediaEngine::Graphics` library became single-thread only 
API.

Anyway, there's an exception - the resource loading. You can load resources
parallelly using OpenGL API. But this require secondary GL context and shared
resource group feature. And controlling its operation is too complex, so I do
not support this feature now. Even if I do support this feature, it requires 
complete control on secondary thread, so there will be no general multi-
threading support.
