Design & Plans for Developer
============================





Library Component Separation
----------------------------

Currently, this is the list of component.

-	`Founation`
-	`Mathematics`
-	`Graphics`
-	`Physics`
-	`Transcoding`
-	`Application`

`Foundation` contains fully common features. Mostly about platform
determination and debugging support.

`Mathematics` contains common mathematics support. Main purpose of
this library is providing abstraction with my taste. Most of 
features will be provided using proven existing code such as GLM
or GLKit. This also provides abstracted conversion between several
vector/matrix types among different libraries. For example, we 
have at least 3 different vector/matric types on GLM, GLKit and 
Bullet. Anyway they uses identical memory layout, so they can be 
converted without any cost, and this library provides abstracted 
way. Anyway I can't sure on quaternions, so conversion support for 
quaternion won't be available or will have noticeable cost.

`Graphics` component is mearly a wrapper of OpenGL ES 2.0 API.
But sometimes employs platform-specific features for faster 
implementation. For example, text drawing logic will be done in 
platform specific way.

`Physics` *is* just a wrapper of BulletPhysics. Currently, there's
no extra abstraction. This library is provided to avoid building
hardness on mobile platform.

`Transcoding` is currently empty library. This will be filled with
resource serialization features. And the classes may be adapted 
by ERTE(Eonil's Resource Tree Encoder) to provide convenient resource linking.
Currently, I don't have high demand on this feature, so I don't 
implement this.

`Application` provides higher-level convenient utility features.
For example, building main application event loop and OpenGL context
is repeating, boring but still difficult work. This library provides
pre-built assembly which does all the stuffs. This is a kind of all-
in-one solution, but of course, not highly customizable. If you want
fully customized event logic and OpenGL context handling, then you
have to write them yourself. *Optional* or *cutomizable* 
implementation usually makes maintenance too hard, so I explicitly 
prohibits the cutomizable design.


















`Improvisation` namespace
-------------------------
This will be dropped as soon as ready.

























Don't! Why?
-----------

-	`GenericDynamicArray`

	Use `std::unique_ptr<std::array<T>>` which is standard.




-	`GenericMemoryBlock` 

	Needs for this class feature usually means bad ownership design.
	I couldn't find nice use-case yet, and will be erased if I fail to find one.
















Deprecation Management
----------------------


-	*LEGACY* means the feature is not used anymore, and should be erased.
	I do not guarantee the legacy feature will work.
	This is an old style deprecation. If the symbol naming style is not compatible with
	versioning.

-	*DEPRECATED* means the feature is working but has serious design defect.
	So there is (or will be) a new replacement, and the deprecated one shouldn't be used anymore.
