DEVNOTE for Graphics Server
===========================

All the server-side objects are proxied with corresponding proxy object.
This is very thin wrapper around OpenGL API, and follows its bare-bone 
lifetime management. In other words, it does not perform any management.

You usually passes several resources (buffers, textures and programs) into
several objects, and the objects will not claim any ownership of them. 
Anyway still they're referencing the resources, so the resource objects
must be alive when the components are accessing them. And the that's users'
responsibility to keep them alive.
