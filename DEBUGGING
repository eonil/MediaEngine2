DEBUGGING
=========







This library contains several debugging aids.



-	Virtual reference counting.

	All the server-side object proxy does unique ownrship. Anyway they references each other
	and this dependency shouldn't be broken while a resource is being used.
	
	So, for the debug build, I used a specially designed pointer object. This counts references,
	but does not perform lifecycle management. It just counts references, and checks early 
	resource deallocation. If once an early resource deallocation detected, then this it will
	be notified to users via an exception.
	
	This checks are very heavy, so enabled only in debug version.

	See these classes for the details.
