Brief
-----
This is a renewal of legacy Eonil Game Engine which written in 2013.


Implementation Guidelines
-------------------------
-	Remove all the unnecessary code and projects from legacy.
-	Move all the code from legacy as much as possible.
	-	EonilGraphics -> EonilImprovisationsGraphics.
-	Some project need to be re-written. Keep the legacy, and port
	gradually. Initial code may directly refer legacy.
-	Legacy code is a copied one. It can be edited freely. Original
	legacy code is kept in separate space.






External Components
-------------------

-	GLM	0.9.5.1

	Completely embedded, and no API will be exposed to user code.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Library Separation
------------------
Libraries are separated to mark clear dependency. No any other practical reason.
